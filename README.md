## Overview

This repository hosts materials related to the preprint:

**Explaining Safety Is Not Enforcing Safety: Cross-Vendor Evidence of Contextual, Surface, and Epistemic Failures in Consumer AI Assistants** (2026).

The study reports longitudinal, cross-surface behavioral testing of four major consumer AI assistants and documents systematic *articulation–application gaps*: cases where systems clearly explain safety rules and subsequently violate those same rules under realistic contextual drift.

Rather than evaluating safety by refusal quality in isolation, the work proposes assessing **constraint persistence across context** as a robustness metric.
